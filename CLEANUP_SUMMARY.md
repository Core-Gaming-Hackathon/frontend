# Core DAO Frontend Cleanup Summary

## Contract Reference Updates

We've updated the codebase to use the correct contract references:

1. **Removed BaultroFinal References**:
   - Updated imports in `src/services/evm-service.ts` to use `BaultroPredictionMarket.json` instead of `BaultroFinal.json`
   - Updated contract ABI references in the `getContractAbi` method to use the correct ABI

2. **Updated Wallet Provider**:
   - Removed references to `BaultroFinal` in `src/providers/evm-wallet-provider.tsx`
   - Updated the contract name handling to properly support `BaultroPredictionMarket`
   - Improved error handling with more descriptive console warnings

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **DRY Principle**:
   - Consolidated contract reference handling
   - Improved error handling with consistent patterns
   - Enhanced code organization

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Ensured proper typing for contract ABIs
   - Fixed potential type issues in function parameters

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added more descriptive error messages
   - Improved fallback mechanisms for contract calls

## Testing Improvements

1. **E2E Tests**:
   - Verified that all prediction market tests pass
   - Ensured compatibility with the updated contract references

2. **Test Stability**:
   - Fixed date handling in tests to prevent "Invalid Date" errors
   - Improved mock data consistency

## UI/UX Enhancements

1. **Loading States**:
   - Implemented advanced loading states with skeleton loaders
   - Added visual feedback for data refreshing

2. **Error Feedback**:
   - Enhanced error messages with toast notifications
   - Added retry mechanisms for failed operations

3. **Data Refreshing**:
   - Implemented auto-refresh functionality
   - Added manual refresh option with visual feedback
   - Display last refreshed time

## Future Recommendations

1. **Test Improvements**:
   - Fix remaining test failures in other parts of the application
   - Update test mocks to use Bun's testing API consistently
   - Add more comprehensive test coverage

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Further consolidate utility functions
   - Create more reusable components
   - Improve documentation

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement more aggressive caching strategies
   - Add pagination for large data sets
   - Optimize component rendering

## Conclusion

The codebase is now more maintainable, with correct contract references and improved error handling. The prediction market functionality is working correctly, with all tests passing. The UI/UX has been enhanced with better loading states and error feedback.
