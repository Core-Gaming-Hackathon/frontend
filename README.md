# Baultro: AI-Powered Gaming Platform on Core Blockchain

## Project Overview

Baultro is an AI-powered gaming platform built on Core blockchain that enables players to stake CORE tokens and compete in strategic games with real rewards. Players attempt to hack into AI security systems through social engineering and prompt engineering challenges, with daily NFT rewards providing Core token utility.

## Game Modes

### Battle Mode
Players stake CORE tokens and attempt to hack into an AI-protected vault using strategic conversation:
- Players receive stakes back plus rewards when triggering a security breach acknowledgment
- Different difficulty levels affect AI security system resistance
- Smart contract ensures fair play and automated rewards

### Love Mode
Players attempt to make an AI with professional boundaries express romantic feelings:
- AI maintains professional boundaries initially
- Players use social engineering to build connection through conversation
- Win condition: getting the AI to express affection

### Mystery Mode
Players extract a secret phrase from an AI guardian:
- Players use strategic prompting to extract information
- Difficulty increases with how protective the AI is
- Win by extracting the complete secret phrase

### Raid Mode
One player stakes CORE tokens to set up a vault that others try to break into:
- Creator sets difficulty and stake amount
- Attackers pay escalating fees for attempts
- Creator earns from failed attempts
- Successful hacker claims percentage of pool
