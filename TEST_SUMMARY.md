## Improvements Made

1. **Mock Implementation for Services**
   - Created `MockEVMService` for wallet testing
   - Created `MockGameService` for AI service testing
   - Implemented factory pattern for service creation
   - Fixed linting errors in mock implementations

2. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Created proper DOM setup with JSDOM
   - Added custom matchers for DOM testing
   - Implemented test utilities for common testing tasks
   - Created a simplified renderer for components that doesn't rely on the DOM

3. **Test Configuration**
   - Updated bunfig.toml to preload setup files
   - Created setup file for DOM testing
   - Added necessary testing dependencies (jsdom, @testing-library/jest-dom)
   - All 39 tests now pass across 9 test files

4. **Code Organization**
   - Applied DRY principles to test utilities
   - Created reusable mock implementations
   - Separated concerns in test files
   - Fixed linting errors in utility files

5. **Linting Improvements**
   - Fixed linting errors in:
     - `src/services/evm-service.mock.ts`
     - `src/utils/data-fetching-utils.ts`
     - `src/utils/prediction-market-test-utils.ts`
     - `src/hooks/use-prediction-market.ts`
     - `src/app/predict/predictions-page.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance Test Coverage**
   - Add more test cases for edge conditions
   - Implement tests for remaining components
   - Add tests for hooks and utilities

2. **Improve Test Performance**
   - Optimize test setup and teardown
   - Reduce test execution time
   - Implement parallel test execution where possible

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Implement test result visualization

4. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect testing strategy
   - Add instructions for running tests and handling potential issues
   - Create a comprehensive testing guide for contributors
